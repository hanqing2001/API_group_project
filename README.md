## Project Overview

## Setup & Instructions

## Further Implementations & Extensions
To expand our API - here are some things we could implement:
- Add food groups to the ingredients, and therefore be able to categorise and choose ingredients based on this
- Be able to remove a recipe from the User's favourite list
- Display the ratings given by each user
- Add a new ingredient, and search recipes that contain this ingredient.
